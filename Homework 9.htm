<p>I chose Idaho since I visited the state in 2018. Since agriculture is its fourth largest industry, I focused on this aspect for my choropleth. I made a ratio (Equal Count) for the amount of inidivduals employed in the Agriculture, Forestry, Hunting and Fishing, and Mining sector. I added vectors that I felt were relevant to the data. Tourism and Agritourism play a major role in these job fields and are actually the third largest industries in the state, so I included major tourist attractions and nearby camp sites to illustrate how some of these jobs depend on visitors from out-of-state. Fishing is also a big contributor to Idaho's economy. I added vectors for Fish Hatcheries and Boating Access Points to show how these locations might influence employment in this sector. The map was projected in NAD83 EPSG:4269.</p>
