<h1>Homework 10: Geoprocessing Analysis</h1>

<h3>Is there a correlation between bigfoot sightings and proximity to marijuana retailers? </h3>
<p>While searching for data and a topic on the internet, I stumbled upon a shapefile for bigfoot sightings across the world and knew I had to use it. Since the greatest amount of bigfoot sighting in the United States occurs in Washington, I chose to base my map on this state. As I struggled to find other data, I came across articles about marijuana tax revenue in the state and realzied that recreational use is legal in Washington. I immediately decided upon my "real-life" question. The map I created (EPSG:104866) depicts both locations of bigfoot sightings and marijuana retailers. I included wilderness areas in Washington for context. Although I found no direct relationship, I refuse to believe it is a coincidence.

<p>For my geoprocessing tools, I used intersection, clip, and buffer. I used intersection to limit the bigfoot sightings just to Washington since the shapefile was for global sightings. I utilized clip for the wilderness areas, again to limit it to Washington from a national scale, and since I didn't need any of the other data that came with the file. Finally, I used the buffer tool to determine a relationship between bigfoot sightings and marijuana retailers by placing a 25km buffer around the retailer locations. Again, I believe there is a strong correlation between marijuana availability and bigfoot sightings but there is no proof of causation.</p>
