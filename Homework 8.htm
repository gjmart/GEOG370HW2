<h1>Homework 8: Census Data Ratios and Categories</h1>
<h2>Gabriela Martinez</h2>

<h3>Choropleth 1</h3>
<p>This map illustrates how many Hispanics/Latinos have a Bachelor's Degree or other higher certification using the natural breaks ratio. This ratio is important for understanding how accessible higher education is to a minority group. Using natural breaks, the data is easier to interpret and more clearly shown through the color districution on the map. However, this mode can lead wide ranges between the different classes which can minimalize the actual distribution of the data.</p>

<h4>Choropleth 2</h4>
<p>This map depicts how many whites have a Bachelor's Degree or higher using the quantile ratio. This ratio is a good comparison for the first choropleth in trying to distinguish how race/ethinicity might effect the likelihood of obtaining a Bachelor's degree or another higher degree. The use of the quantile mode allows for the same number of data to be placed into each class in an increasing order which is excellent for emphasizing the difference between the lowest and highest quantiles. A disadvantage of this mode is the wide range of values that can be placed into a class since there are only a total of five classes. This can lead to uneven distribution.</p>

<h5>Choropleth 3</h5>
<p>This map represents how many 25 year olds and over have obtained a Bachelor's Degree or higher using the equal interval ratio. This ratio is also good for comparisons with the other choropleths, as well as depicting the data for everyone 25 and over that has a Bachelor's degree or higher. The mode used was equal intervals which separates the data into classes of equal size and is most useful for continuous datasets. This mode allows for the data to be interpreted easily. A con for equal intervals is that the distribution of data often leads to majority of the data falling into one or two classes which leads to monochrome maps.</p>
